## Beginner Level
## Task 1
### Name of Project : Iris Flowers Classification ML Project
Project Description : This particular ML project is usually referred to as the “Hello World” of Machine Learning. The iris flowers dataset contains numeric attributes, and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms, mainly how to load and handle data. Also, since this is a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities.
## Machine Learning Algorithm Used
Supervised Learning (Logistic regression,KNN-k-nearest neighbours, Decision Tree)

## Task 2
## Name of Project : Stock Market Prediction And Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM
Project Description : we use stacked LSTm model to predect the stock movememt for nect 30 days by following its previous behavior
